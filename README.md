# TrueFreeze DeFi Frontend II

True Freeze is an autonomous protocol allowing anyone to lock ETH out of circulation ("proof of patience") and mint frETH yield tokens and a tradeable Certificate of Deposit Freezer NFT for doing so.

This repo is where the New (and hopefully improved) web2 frontend for TrueFreeze will live. 

Many design elements have been provide directly by the founding TrueFreeze team to help bring back to life the magic of TrueFreeze.
